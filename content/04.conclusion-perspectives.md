## Conclusion & Perspectives {.page_break_before}

At its current development stage, and despite its diligent assembly, data compiled in LOTUS remains imperfect and, by its nature, at least partially biased. As discussed above, in the context of bioactive NP research and due to global editorial practices, publications tend to emphasize new compounds for which interesting bioactivity has been measured. In contrast, ubiquitous compounds are poorly documented. For the time being, until more rigorous data becomes available, this provides a partial yet relatively comprehensive view on the actual metabolome of all studied organisms, including the more thoroughly studied model organisms. The comprehensive editing opportunities provided within LOTUS and by the associated Wikidata distribution platform open new opportunities for collaborative community engagement, which the authors believe is the most efficient means of correcting any remaining bias.
Moreover, the dissemination of referenced structure-organism pairs through Wikidata, together with the harmonized data format enables query of an increasingly globalized NP research knowledge from a radically novel perspective. All researchers involved in NP research and special aspects of metabolism can benefit from this opportunity, whether the interest is in ecology and evolution, chemical ecology, drug discovery, biosynthesis pathway elucidation, chemotaxonomy, or similar research fields.
The introduction of LOTUS also provides a new opportunity to advance the FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship established in 2016 (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Researchers widely acknowledge the availability of data that has been unavailable, and at least in part even been discouraged, e.g., due to page limitations and mechanisms involved in the calculation of journal impact factors) by the classical print and static PDF publication formats. In particular raw data such as experimental readings, spectroscopic data, instrumental measurements, statistical, and other calculations are valued by all, but disseminated by only very few. The immense value of raw data and the desire to advance the public dissemination has recently been documented in detail for NMR spectroscopic data by a large consortium of NP researchers (McAlpine et al., 2019). While first steps in this direction are currently being taken (for example: Harvard Dataverse repositories for individual research groups [Pauli group at UIC: dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/gfpuic] and projects [dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/cenapt]; an NIH-funded raw NMR data repository [www.np-mrd.org/]), one missing element in this multifaceted development is the adequate incentivization of community efforts; to generate the vital flow of contributed data, the effort associated with preparing and submitting content to open repositories should be better acknowledged in academia, government, regulatory, and industrial environments. Moreover, data reuse should also be acknowledged (Cousijn et al., 2018, 2019; Pierce et al., 2019).
The possibilities for expansion and future applications of Wikidata-hosted LOTUS data are significant. For example, properly formatted spectral data, e.g. data obtained by mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance, can be linked to the Wikidata entries for the respective chemical compounds. MassBank (Horai et al., 2010) and SPLASH (Wohlgemuth et al., 2016) identifiers are already reported in Wikidata, and this existing information can be used to report MassBank records for single organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana compounds (https://w.wiki/335H). Such possibilities will help to bridge experimental data results obtained during the early stages of NP research with data that has been reported and formatted previously in different content. This will open exciting new perspectives in the area of structural dereplication and NP annotation. The authors have previously demonstrated that taxonomically-informed metabolite annotation can critically improve the NP annotation process (Rutz et al., 2019). Alternative approaches linking structural annotation to biological organisms have also shown tremendous improvements (Hoffmann et al., 2021). The availability of LOTUS as an open repository that links chemical objects to both their spectral information and biological occurrences will facilitate such applications significantly.
As shown in SI-4, observing the chemical and biological diversity at various granularity levels can offer new insights. Regarding the chemical objects involved, it will be important to implement chemical taxonomy annotations for the Wikidata entries. However, this is a rather complex task, for which stability and coverage issues will have to be addressed first. Existing chemical taxonomies such as ChEBI, ClassyFire, or NPClassifier are evolving steadily, and it will be important to constantly update the tools used to make further annotations. Repositioning NP within their greater biosynthetic context is another major challenge. The fact that LOTUS is disseminated on Wikidata should facilitate its integration within biological pathway databases such as WikiPathways and contribute to this complex task (Martens et al., 2020; Slenter et al., 2018).
In the field of ecology, molecular traits are gaining increased attention (Kessler and Kalske, 2018; Sedio, 2017). Conceptually, LOTUS can help associate classical plant traits (e.g., leaf surface area, photosynthetic capacities, etc.) with Wikidata biological organisms entries, and thus, allow the integration and comparison with chemicals that are associated with the organisms. Likewise, the association of biogeography data documented in repositories such as GBIF could be further exploited in Wikidata to pursue the exciting but understudied topic of “chemodiverse hotspots” (Defossez et al., 2021).
Other NP-related information is of great interest but unfortunately remains poorly formatted. For example, traditional medicine (including ethnomedicine and ethnobotany) is the historical and empiric approach of mankind to discover and use bioactive products from Nature, primarily plants. The amount of knowledge generated in human history on the use of medicinal substances represents fascinating yet underutilized information. To this end, LOTUS represents a resource for new concepts by which such information could be valued and conserved in the digital era, as it provides a blueprint for appropriate formatting and sharing of such data (Allard et al., 2018; Cordell, 2017b, 2017a).
The various facets discussed above represent future developments that the combination of LOTUS and the Wikidata knowledge base can feasibly accommodate. Behind the scenes, all underlying resources represent data in a multidimensional space and can be extracted as individual graphs that can be interconnected. The craft of appropriate federated queries allows users to navigate these spaces and graphs and fully exploit their potential (Kratochvíl, 2018; Waagmeester et al., 2020). The development of interfaces such as RDFFrames (Mohamed et al., 2020) will also facilitate the use of the wide arsenal of existing machine learning approaches to automate reasoning on these knowledge graphs - efficiently complementing human interpretation, validation, and thinking.
Overall, the LOTUS project is intended to give the pharmacognosy et al. research community access to a greater quantity and better quality of data and, thereby, ultimately pave the way towards a global open NP database. This reflects the authors’ belief that the integration of NP research results requires a truly open and FAIR knowledge-based in the form of a DB structure, and this approach will fuel a virtuous (rather than a vicious) cycle of research habits aiming at a better understanding of Life and its chemistry.
