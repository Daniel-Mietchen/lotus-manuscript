## Abstract {.page_break_before}

As contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities are reshaping natural products research, major benefits could result from the availability of an open database of referenced structure-organism pairs. Such pairs allow the documentation of distinct molecular structures found as components of heterogeneous chemical matrices originating from living organisms. The references to the work describing the structure-organism relationship are also highly valuable since they ideally detail the experimental work leading to the occurrence reporting. However current databases covering such information suffer from paywall restrictions, limited taxonomic scope, poorly standardized fields, and lack of interoperability. To address these issues, we established the LOTUS project to collect and curate a set of structure-organism pairs from publicly available natural products databases and yield an ensemble of over 500,000 curated and referenced structure-organism pairs. To provide open access as well as standardized linking to other resources, LOTUS data is hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on [https://lotus.naturalproducts.net](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net).  The diffusion of these referenced structure-organism pairs within the Wikidata framework addresses many of the limitations of currently available databases, opens the possibility of community curation and facilitates linkage to existing biological and chemical data resources. All programs and code developed for data gathering, curation, and dissemination are made publicly available. The LOTUS project, which follows the FAIR (<ins>F</ins>indability, <ins>A</ins>ccessibility, <ins>I</ins>nteroperability, and <ins>R</ins>euse) principles in research, represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.
