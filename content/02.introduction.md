### Evolution of Natural Product Databases

Natural products (NP) research is a transdisciplinary field with scopes ranging from fundamental structural aspects of naturally-occuring molecular entities to their effects on living organisms, and even the study of chemically-mediated interactions within entire ecosystems. Technological and methodological developments are constantly reshaping NP research, a field steeped in history, with a rich legacy of experimental practices [@doi:10/ggb79p]. In particular, contemporary bioinformatic approaches enable the (re-)interpretation and (re-)annotation of datasets documenting molecular aspects of biodiversity [@doi:10/gcg6xw]. To efficiently annotate previously reported NP, or to identify and report new entities, these tools rely on properly maintained NP databases (DB) [@doi:10/gfwm27]. Despite the ambiguous definition of “natural” [@doi:10/bkfd8h], if we assume that a NP is a chemical entity *found in* a living organism, a DB should contain, at minimum, a list of chemical entities, organisms, and references to the work(s) establishing the links between them. If large, well-structured, and freely accessible DB, composed only of chemical structures (e.g. [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) [@doi:10/gfxmsx], with over 100M entries) or biological organisms (e.g. [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) [@GBIFOrg2020], with over 1,400M entries) their scarce interlinkage limits their applications. 
Currently, no open, cross-kingdom and comprehensive DB links NP and their producing organisms, along with information about the experimental works describing those links. If referenced structure-organism pairs are critical evidence for pharmacognosy and related NP research, they remain poorly accessible ([@doi:10/gh533j]. Pioneering efforts led to the establishment of [KNApSAck](http://www.knapsackfamily.com/KNApSAcK/) [@doi:10.1007/3-540-29782-0_13], which is likely the first public curated DB of referenced structure-organism pairs. KNApSAck currently contains over 50,000 structures and over 100,000 structure-organism pairs. However, the organism field is not standardized and downloads are complicated. The [NAPRALERT](https://www.napralert.org/) dataset [@doi:10.1016/b978-008045382-8.00060-5], compiled over five decades, gathers annotated data derived from over 200,000 primary NP literature sources and contains 200,000 distinct compound names and structural elements, along with over 500,000 records of distinct structure-organism pairs. In total, it represents over 900,000 total records of pairs due to equivalent structure-organism pairs reported in different citations. NAPRALERT is fully searchable but uses an access model with limited free searches. Finally, the [NPAtlas](https://www.npatlas.org/) [@doi:10/gh5ptm] is a recent project aimed at complying with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse) guidelines for digital assets [@doi:10/bdd4] and offering web access. While the NPAtlas encourages submission of new compounds with their biological source, it focuses on microbial NP and ignores a wide range of biosynthetically active organisms, such as the plant kingdom. Most available NP DB provide entries without referencing their origin, thereby breaking the precious link required for tracing information back to the original data and assessing its quality. Even valuable efforts for compiling NP data made by commercial DB distributors, such as the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP), are missing proper documentation of this critical information, precluding further computational use or exhaustive review. Building on the recently published COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (COCONUT) [@doi:10/ghssx5], LOTUS addresses these shortcomings, with over 500,000 distributed, referenced structure-organism pairs. After harmonization, each documented structure-organism pair was curated at the chemical, biological, and reference level, resulting in high quality, computer-interpretable identifiers.

### Accommodating Principles of FAIRness and TRUSTworthiness

To avoid the classic pitfalls of public scientific DB creation [@doi:10/gc4h7x], and to enhance current and future sharing, the LOTUS project selected [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) as the most suitable platform for disseminating its resources. 
Since its creation, Wikidata focuses on cross-disciplinary and multilingual support. It is curated and governed collaboratively by a global community of volunteers, about 20,000 of which are contributing monthly. Wikidata currently contains more than 1 billion statements in the form of subject-predicate-object triples. They are machine-interpretable and can be enriched with qualifiers and references. They correspond to ~90 million entries, which can be grouped into classes as diverse as countries, songs, disasters, or chemical compounds. They are closely integrated with Wikipedia and serve as the source for its infoboxes. Various workflows have been established for reporting such classes, particularly those of interest to life sciences, such as genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, or biological taxa [@doi:10/ggqqc6].
Building on the principles and experiences described above, this article introduces the development and implementation of a workflow for NP occurrence curation and dissemination using both FAIR and TRUST (Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology) principles [@doi:10/ggwrtj]. The presented data upload and retrieval procedures ensure optimal data accessibility by the research community, allowing any researcher to contribute and reuse the data with a clear and open license ([Creative Commons 0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)).
Despite many advantages, Wikidata hosting of the LOTUS project has some drawbacks. While the SPARQL query language offers a powerful way to query available data, it can also appear intimidating at first for an inexperienced user. Furthermore, some typical queries of molecular DB such as structural or spectral search are not yet available in Wikidata. To bridge this gap, LOTUS is hosted in parallel at [https://lotus.naturalproducts.net](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net) (LNPN) within the naturalproducts.net ecosystem of databases and tools. LNPN is periodically updated with the latest LOTUS data. The advantage of this dual hosting is a community-curated and vast knowledge-based integrated DB (via Wikidata), as well as a NP community-oriented product with tailored search modes (via LNPN). The LOTUS project and its multiple data interaction options provide the basis for transparent and sustainable ways to access, share, and create knowledge on NP occurrence. More broadly, LOTUS will foster cross-fertilization of the fields of chemistry and biology and associated disciplines.

### Structure of this Article 

The first section presents an overview of the LOTUS blueprint at its current stage of development, keeping in mind that it is a constant work-in-progress. As part of this overview, the central collection, curation, and dissemination elements of LOTUS are explained in detail. The second section addresses the interaction between LOTUS and its end-users, including data retrieval, addition, and editing. The third section is dedicated to the interpretation of LOTUS data and illustrates the dimensions and qualities of the current LOTUS dataset from the chemical and biological perspectives.
